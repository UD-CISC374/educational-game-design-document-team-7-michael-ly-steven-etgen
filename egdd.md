## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

Our game combines the fun of popular "feeding-frenzy" type games with the creativity of simple coding, giving players a clear sense of how methods and attributes are used in games behind the scenes as they play.

## Influences (Brief)

- *Influence #1*: Feeding Frenzy
  - Medium: Video game
  - Explanation: This is a simple yet addicting game where you start with a relatively small fish. Your fish can get bigger in size by eating enough fish that are 	smaller than it. As your fish gets bigger, it can start targeting fish that used to be bigger than it. This game has a similiar style to Feeding Frenzy. We use a similiar concept with our game as you gain the ability to call methods as you eat fish of smaller size.

  - Explanation: 


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Gameplay Mechanic #1: Get the ability to control your shark through calling methods and changing attributes as you eat fish of smaller size.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #2: Input a method that grows your shark.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #3: Input a method that changes your shark's speed.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #4: Input a method that changes your shark's color and other physical attributes.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #5: Move the shark by pressing and holding the arrow keys.

# Learning Aspects

- Learn simple coding practices such as method calls and how attributes work

## Learning Domains

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*

 - Coding/Programming (method calls, attributes, etc.)

## Target Audiences

*Who are your learners?*

- Middle and high school students with an interest in learning simple coding practices

## Target Contexts

*Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).*

 - Introduction to programming classes
 - Informal free time for students that want to learn some simple coding practices

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- Correctly call methods: By the end of the game, players will be able to call methods correctly by passing in inputs the right way. 
- Identify attributes: By the end of the game, players will be able to identify attributes from an object.
- Change attributes: By the end of the game, players will be able to change attributes of an object through calling methods.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Prior to the game, players need to be able to define the concept of a Java class.
- Prior to the game, players need to be able to create an instance of a Java class.

## Assessment Measures

- Given a function declaration, call the function correctly.
- Given a list of attributes, modify the attributes through calling methods correctly.

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- Gives the player complete control (to an extent) over how the shark grows and changes throughout the game. This teaches simple method calls and other basic programming knowlegde at the same time.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a game for one person, they use keyboard to take control of the game character (shark). 

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- Classic: Classic mode is the base mode of the game. The player works to grow his shark through the use of methods and attributes.
- *Player mode #2*: *Description*
- *etc.*

# Gameplay Objectives

- Change/Evolve your shark:
    - Description: Control your shark and eat smaller fish to evolve, and change other aspects of yourself.
    - Alignment: Gives the player the ability to directly control the shark's appearance through the calling of methods and changing of simple attributes. The player will see the exact changes that they are making through simple coding practices.
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #1*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #2*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #3*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*
The player will begin the game with control of the shark, and rules will appear simply. For example, the first rule given will be to eat a smaller fish. When that task is completed, the next objective will be displayed to the player.

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*
Our shark begins small and plain, and as the player progresses through the game he can grow and become larger. Eventually, he will overcome the dangerous obsticles of the sea to become an apex predator.

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
