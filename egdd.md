## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

Our game combines the fun of popular "feeding-frenzy" type games with the creativity of simple coding, giving players a clear sense of how methods and attributes are used in games behind the scenes as they play.

## Influences (Brief)

- *Influence #1*: Feeding Frenzy
  - Medium: Video game
  - Explanation: This is a simple yet addicting game where you start with a relatively small fish. Your fish can get bigger in size by eating enough fish that are 	smaller than it. As your fish gets bigger, it can start targeting fish that used to be bigger than it. This game has a similiar style to Feeding Frenzy. We use a similiar concept with our game as you gain the ability to call methods as you eat fish of smaller size.

  - Explanation: 


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Gameplay Mechanic #1: Get the ability to control your shark through calling methods and changing attributes as you eat fish of smaller size.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #2: Input a method that grows your shark.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #3: Input a method that changes your shark's speed.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #4: Input a method that changes your shark's color and other physical attributes.
- *Gameplay Mechanic #5: Move the shark by pressing and holding the arrow keys.

# Learning Aspects

- Learn simple coding practices such as method calls and how attributes work

## Learning Domains

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*

 - Coding/Programming (method calls, attributes, etc.)

## Target Audiences

*Who are your learners?*

- Middle and high school students with an interest in learning simple coding practices

## Target Contexts

*Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).*

 - Introduction to programming classes
 - Informal free time for students that want to learn some simple coding practices

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- Correctly call methods: By the end of the game, players will be able to call methods correctly by passing in inputs the right way. 
- Identify attributes: By the end of the game, players will be able to identify attributes from an object.
- Change attributes: By the end of the game, players will be able to change attributes of an object through calling methods.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Prior to the game, players need to be able to define the concept of a Java class.
- Prior to the game, players need to be able to create an instance of a Java class.

## Assessment Measures

- Given a function declaration, call the function correctly.
- Given a list of attributes, modify the attributes through calling methods correctly.

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- Gives the player complete control (to an extent) over how the shark grows and changes throughout the game. This teaches simple method calls and other basic programming knowlegde at the same time.
- Gives the player an addicting game with a simple objective, while letting them customize their sharkâ€™s appearance and other physical attributes. This will let them be creative and build a unique gaming experience, all while teaching them programming fundamentals.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This game is for one person, they use a keyboard to take control of the game character(shark), which includes moving the shark as well as modifying the attributes of the shark. 

## Player Modes

- Title Screen: This is the title screen of the game where players can choose to start their playthrough. The title screen will transition to the main game when the player clicks the start button.
- Main Game: Classic mode is the base mode of the game. The player works to grow his shark through the use of methods and attributes. The player will be able to transition to a menu screen by clicking the menu button at the top of the game.
- Menu Screen: The player will be able to access transition back to the main game or the title screen by clicking the appropriate button in the menu screen.


# Gameplay Objectives

- Change/Evolve your shark:
    - Description: Control your shark and eat smaller fish to evolve, and change other aspects of yourself.
    - Alignment: Gives the player the ability to directly control the shark's appearance through the calling of methods and changing of simple attributes. The player will see the exact changes that they are making through simple coding practices.
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

- You can move the shark across the screen and eat smaller fish.
- You can use methods to modify your shark at a certain point. 

# Rules

- If the shark eats fish smaller than it, points will be rewarded.
- If the shark attempts to eat fish bigger than it, the player is penalized by decreasing the total number of points.

# Objects/Entities

- There is a shark with a variable size or color.
- There are fish with variable size.
- There is a score at the top of the screen.


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Control your shark: You can move the shark anywhere on the screen using the arrow keys on your keyboard, eat fish that are smaller than your shark and avoid fish that are bigger than it. Your total score should increase if you eat smaller fish and decrease if you eat bigger fish.
- Upgrade your shark: If you gain enough points, upgrade your shark by calling methods. You can either make your shark faster or bigger. The end goal is to get enough points to beat the game.

    
## Feedback

- If you eat fish that are smaller than the shark, your total score will go up, which will be presented at the top of the screen.
- If you eat fish that are bigger than the shark, your total score decreases.
- Gaining enough points to beat the game will display text to congratulate you.


# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*
- The player will begin the game with control of the shark, and rules will appear simply. For example, the first rule given will be to eat a smaller fish. When that task is completed, the next objective will be displayed to the player.

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*
- Our shark begins small and plain, and as the player progresses through the game he can grow and become larger. Eventually, he will overcome the dangerous obsticles of the sea to become an apex predator.

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
